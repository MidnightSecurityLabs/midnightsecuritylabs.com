                     <p>At Midnight Security Labs, we specialize in managing ransomware attacks, including safe handling of cryptocurrency transactions if payment becomes an unavoidable last resort. Our approach prioritizes rapid incident response to contain and mitigate the impact of ransomware, alongside exploring all possible recovery options. In scenarios where decryption without payment is not feasible and after other avenues have been exhausted, we assist in the secure and compliant handling of cryptocurrency transactions to resolve such situations responsibly and effectively. Our team ensures that all actions taken align with legal and ethical standards, providing guidance on the implications and strategies for dealing with digital ransom demands.</p>

            <strong>How often should we conduct Penetration Testing and Red Teaming exercises?</strong>
            <p>The frequency of these tests can vary depending on several factors including changes in network infrastructure, compliance requirements, and previous security incidents.

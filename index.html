We tailor our approach based on the complexity and specific requirements of your systems, ensuring that every critical component is covered without disrupting your day-to-day operations. Our goal is to provide a clear and structured framework that aligns perfectly with your security needs.

<strong>What is the difference between Red Teaming and Penetration Testing?</strong>
<p>
        Penetration Testing is a targeted approach that focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in your systems and network.

<strong>How often should we conduct Penetration Testing and Red Teaming exercises?</strong>
<p>
        The frequency of these tests can vary depending on several factors including changes in network infrastructure, compliance requirements, and previous security incidents. Generally, we recommend Penetration Testing annually and Red Teaming at least once every two years, or more frequently for industries at higher risk.
